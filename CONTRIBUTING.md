Thank you for your interest in contributing to ResFoD!

## Code Structure

This repository focuses on the core model implementation:

- `models/`: Core model architectures
- `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers
- `METHODOLOGY.md`: Detailed technical documentation

Training and inference scripts are intentionally excluded to keep the repository focused on the core methodology.

## Development Guidelines

1. Follow the existing code style and architecture patterns
2. Add appropriate docstrings for new functions and classes
3. Update `METHODOLOGY.md` if adding significant features
4. Ensure code is compatible with PyTorch >= 1.12.0
